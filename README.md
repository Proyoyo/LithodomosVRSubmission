# Answers & Explanation
I chose Apollo as the GrapQL client because it is more flexible and it is the technology that I am more familiar with.
I chose flow as the static type checker because it integrates with Babel easily.

Improvements that could be made to this submission:
1. The white opaque background behind the experience/scene name & tagline can be adjusted better so that it's more uniform.
2. Some UI elements can be styled better for mobile.
3. Error message could have more details.

If I was allocated more time, I would integrate some useful elements from bootstrap so that the UI is more responsive.
In addition, I'll configure webpack and babel so that it supports legacy browsers.
